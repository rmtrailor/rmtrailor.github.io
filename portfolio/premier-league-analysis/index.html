                <h1>The Dataset</h1>
                <p>
                    The Premier League is an English Football League, and is
                    the primary football league in the UK. This Dataset details the data from the
                    2015 - 2016 season for the Premier League. Each row in this dataset is a match
                    played between two teams, and each column in the dataset is some form of information
                    or statistic for that match such as the home/away team, home/away goals, home/away
                    shots on target, assits, etc.

                <h1>Motivation</h1>
                <p>
                    My main motivation for doing this dataset is because Iâ€™m a fan of soccer and I like watching
                    the Premier League (my favorite club/team is Manchester City). I want to analyze the data
                    because I want to see how certain clubs performed against other clubs during the season. I also
                    want to make some in-depth shot-type analysis. Data is a very important aspect of sports
                    especially when it involves the performance of the team or its players, so I feel this dataset
                    will help me with creating visuals that can be analyzed for performance breakdowns and game
                    reviews.

                <h2>How Well Do the Teams Perform Against Each Other?</h2>

                    <b>Description: </b> <br />
                    This Heatmap depicts the performance of teams against other teams in the league.
                    The colors of the cells coordinate with the performance of the team on the y-axis
                    against the team on the x-axis. Green values mean that the team performs better
                    than the opposing team. Where as a red value means that the team doesn't perform better than
                    the other team. White values mean that the performance values equaled out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The performance is evaluated in terms of goals scored against the other team.
                    For this implementation, each team has their own scorecard detailing a score value
                    against the other teams. If Team A wins against Team B, then a <i>score</i> value
                    is calculated based on the Team A Goals &ndash; Team B Goals. This value is added for Team A's
                    score against Team B's and is deducted for Team B's score against Team A. This would be
                    reversed if Team B was the victor. In the event of a tie, no team recieves any points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Findings:</b> <br />
                    Arsenal performed pretty well against most teams, with their main enemies being
                    Southampton and Chelsea. Leicester also performed fairly well against most of the
                    teams, although sometimes they were barely better with a value of 1. Teams like Newcastle
                    and Sunderland performed poorly against a lot of the other teams.
                </p>

                <h2>Who's the Most Accurate Team?</h2>
                <img src="images/shot.jpg" alt="Premier League Shot" width="100%"/>
                <svg id="bar-chart"></svg>
                <p>Some definitions for this visualization: </p>
                <p><b>Shots On Target:</b> Shots that would or does enter the goal post.</p>
                <p><b>Shots Off Target:</b> Shots that would not or does not enter the goal post.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Description: </b> <br />
                    Now for this visualization we are depicting the accuracy as a percentage of the total
                    shots each team attempted during the season. Hovering over each bar gives the number
                    of shots each bar represents as well as the percentage that amount makes up compared
                    to the total number of shots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Findings:</b> <br />
                    The average accuracy for on target shots across all the teams was 45.25%. The most
                    accurate team was Tottenham Hotspur F.C. (Spurs) with an accuracy of 56%. However,
                    if you look at the number of shots they had off target, you can see that the total
                    is more than any other team had on target. The least accurate team was Norwich
                    City F.C. (Norwich) with an accuracy of 40%.
                </p>

                <h2>When Does Each Team Score More Goals?</h2>
                <img src="images/goal.jpg" alt="Premier League Goal" width="100%"/>
                <svg id="parallel"></svg>
                <p>
                    <b>Description: </b> <br />
                    This visualization shows when each team scored their goals during the season.
                    Each y-axis depicts a time section of a match. "0-15" would be the first 15 minutes
                    of the match, "15-30" would be the next 15 minutes, and so on. The first half of a
                    match is the first 45 minutes, and the second half of the match is the second 45
                    minutes (45 - 90). For each half, if the referee decides that more time needs to be
                    added to the clock then there are extra minutes. That's what the y-axis "45+extra"
                    and "90+extra" represent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each line is a different team. If you hover a line a tooltip will pop up that will
                    tell you what team you are currently on. If you click the line, this will brush
                    the lines so that the line you clicked will only have the colors and the other lines
                    will transition to a barely visible gray. This helps analyze a single team's score
                    history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Findings:</b> <br />
                    It's actually common for teams (ex. Manchester City) to score more towards the
                    beginning of each half.
                </p>

                <h2>What Team Has the Better Defense?</h2>

                <svg id="bubble-plot"></svg>
                <p>Some definitions for this visualization:</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Blocks:</b> When player stops an opposing player from getting the ball.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Clearances:</b> Whenever a player hits or kicks the ball away from the goal
                    of his or her own team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Opponent Shots:</b> The opposing teams shots on target against the team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Saves:</b> Whenever the Goalkeeper stops, catches, or punches a ball that would
                    have entered the goal and scored for the opposing team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Description: </b> <br />
                    For this visualization we are analyzing the different defensive stats of each team.
                    The size of each circle correlates to the number of shots the opposing teams were
                    able to get on target. The fill correlates to the number of blocks that team did.
                    If you hover over each circle, a tooltip will pop up which will give you the data
                    for each bubble.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Findings:</b> <br />
                    Sunderland had a lot of defensive plays going on in the season. However, they also
                    had the most opponent shots on them, which may be a correlation. Norwich had the
                    most clearances which seemed to have had an impact because they don't have too many
                    opposing shots on them, and therefore, also less saves from the goalkeeper.
