                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This visualization is a Choropleth Map detailing 311 Tree Maintenance
                   calls in San Francisco from 2015. The colors of the area depict the
                   the total number of reports for that neighborhood. Neighborhoods whose
                   data wasn't available in the dataset has a grey color. Each circle is a
                   311 call at its exact location. Every circle is encoded in two colors:
                   red or blue. Blue circles are calls that have been resolved(closed) and red
                   circles are calls that weren't resolved(open)â€“at least within the time span
                   of the dataset. It's also possible that these calls were closed but
                   weren't documented. Unfortunately, this cannot be determined from
                   the dataset. There is a group of radio buttons to toggle the visibility
                   of these circles. Simply choose whether you want to see all the
                   circles(default option), only the open calls, only the closed calls,
                   or none of circles.</p>

                <h2>Findings</h2>
                <p>The Mission neighborhood and its surrounding neighborhoods seem to
                   have a high amounts of these calls. After a close analysis of these
                   calls, it became apparent that most of these calls were reports of
                   vandalism to the trees. The Mission neighborhood is known infamously
                   for its high concentration of graffiti, so this might be connection
                   for the high ammount of calls for that area. This area also has the
                   highest amount of calls that are still open. Since a lot of graffiti
                   is kept up in that neighborhood, this might explain why some
                   "vandalism" on trees might go unresolved.</p>
